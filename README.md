Sonic 2 Level viewer written in vb.net

This is a viewer for the Sonic 2 levels I made ages ago... It was written in vb.net, I consider the code total garbage by now, so you can do whatever you want with it, I dont really care. Have fun ;)

To use it, you need to open the Sonic 2 ROM in the *.bin format with it (I don't remember the Endianness), it also doesn't work with all ROMs.
